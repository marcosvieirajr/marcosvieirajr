I’m a brazilian Software Engineer with more than 13 years of Java web backend application development experience, currently acting as squad Tech Lead at [Via S.A.](https://www.via.com.br/). I have Docker and Kubernetes experiences, also Apache Kafka and SQL (relational) / NoSQL (non-relational) databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB. 
Enthusiastic about microservices architecture/design and Go language, I have been focusing my studies on preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) certification exam from The Linux Foundation, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam from AWS, as well as Blockchain, Go, and improving my English skills. My free time is spent with movies, series and study. I also love walking on the beach.
